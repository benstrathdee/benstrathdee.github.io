# Welcome to my new Portfolio!

This version of my portfolio was made with ReactJS to replace my first portfolio
made very early on in the \_nology.io bootcamp. It aims to be a nicer visual
experience, with a focus on being more responsive across different screen sizes.

# Portfolio Goals

I wanted to create a dynamic single page app that feels really smooth and
responsive. I was determined to not add any more packages than what gets
installed by Create React App. The only exception I ended up making was just the
use of some Font Awesome packages for their fantastic SVA icons.

Another goal was to be able to easily update the portfolio in the future without
breaking any styling/layout. I achieved this by having certain elements (such as
the list of skills, or the related projects section) pull content from a
singular point and generate components dynamically.

# Running the site locally

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
